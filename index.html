                This is the water dispenser in the CIT. 
                It is meant to dispense water in a contact-free fashion 
                to combat covid, and the user is meant to hover over the actual 
                buttons themselves to eliminate the need to touch a public surface. 
                Note that if the user pushes on the buttons instead of hovering, 
                no water will come out.

                The above is a sketch of the interface. Key components include: the dispense sensor, the 
                hot water sensor, and the various icons showing the status of the dispenser.

        </h3>
        <div class="cap_div">
        <p style="max-width: 800px; text-align: center;">I observed 4 people in total using the dispenser. Most of the users I observed knew how to 
            use the water dispenser. They used the dispenser by hovering their hands over the dispense button,
             and one of them did know how to get hot water. There was one user who was using it for the 
             first time. He spent some time reading the paper sign on the dispenser before hovering his
             hand over the dispense button.

            <li>Is this a good solution for covid?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's too confusing, too many people are gong to accidentally touch it</li>
                    <li>If you know how to use it, it would be effective</li>

                    <li>This was my first time trying to use this</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Without looking back at the cooler, could you describe

                <ul> 
                    <li>Hold over the "Hot Select" button for a few seconds?</li>
                    <li>I've used this before, so you hover over the hot select button and then
                        hover over the dispense button to get hot water
                    </li>
                    <li>Hold the red button for 3 seconds</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I thought they were buttons you could press</li>
                    <li>I think they show whether or not a specific feature is being
